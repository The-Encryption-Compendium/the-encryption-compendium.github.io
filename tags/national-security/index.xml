It is time to start weighing the overall costs and benefits more broadly.</description></item><item><title>U.S. Supercomputer Export Control Policy</title><link>/entries/90/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/90/</guid><description>Authors: House of Representatives, Committee on National Security, Chairman, Hon.
