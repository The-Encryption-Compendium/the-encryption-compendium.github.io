Abstract: An editorial contends that the new White House proposal to keep high-powered encryption software out of the hands of foreign terrorists and criminals is needlessly restrictive and probably unworkable. The editorial says that the technology, which is legal in the US, is a good way for honest citizens to prevent crime and should be disseminated domestically and abroad.</description></item><item><title>A “Stumbling” US Encryption Policy</title><link>/entries/8/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/8/</guid><description>Authors: Madsen, Wayne

Abstract: “Are those in opposition to the administration&amp;rsquo;s [encryption] policy prepared to sacrifice public safety in the interests of commercial gain?” Those words, uttered by Deputy Assistant Attorney General Robert Litt, would etch themselves in the minds of those who attended the 7 May 1977 House International Economic Policy and Trade hearing on “Encryption: Individual Rights vs National Security”. The hearing was held to consider Representative Bob Goodlatte&amp;rsquo;s liberalized encryption export bill.</description></item><item><title>Another Faulty Encryption Policy</title><link>/entries/9/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/9/</guid><description>Published: December 1996

Abstract: Recently, only secret government agencies were concerned about cryptography. It now is an important matter for many individuals and businesses who use the Internet. That has led to an intense effort on the part of several governmental agencies to control cryptography. This article provides an explanation of the evolution of cryptography, a synopsis of the evolving cryptography debate, an examination of the different interests represented within the debate and a framework for analyzing the First Amendment issues that are involved.</description></item><item><title>Encryption Control 'Unconstitutional'</title><link>/entries/164/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/164/</guid><description>Authors: The Associated Press

Abstract: As the 21st century approaches, encryption is presenting a national security dilemma in the US. While the use of strong encryption for computerized data is essential in protecting our nation, widespread, unregulated encryption poses serious problems on two levels: encryption could inhibit the government&amp;rsquo;s ability to enforce the law as well as gather foreign intelligence. As a result, the government has established export controls on encryption products and proposed a &amp;lsquo;key recovery&amp;rsquo; system designed to enable law enforcement officers to access encrypted data in the course of lawful investigations.</description></item><item><title>Executive Order 13026 - Administration of Export Controls on Encryption Products</title><link>/entries/165/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/165/</guid><description>Authors: President Clinton

Abstract: The Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) of 1994 Congress passed the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) in 1994, which forced telephone companies to redesign their network architectures to make it easier for law enforcement to wiretap digital telephone calls. In 2005, CALEA was expanded by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to include Internet service providers (ISPs) and VoIP services like Skype. A few years later, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) began pushing legislation trying to expand CALEA to all online communications software.</description></item><item><title>First and Fifth Amendment Challenges to Export Controls on Encryption: Bernstein and Karn</title><link>/entries/162/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/162/</guid><description>Authors: Pilkington, Laura M.

Abstract: In 1993, the US Government proposed a novel (and highly controversial) approach to cryptography, called key escrow. Key escrow cryptosystems used standard symmetric- and public- key ciphers, key management techniques and protocols, but with one added feature: a copy of the current session key, itself encrypted with a key known to the government, was sent at the beginning of every encrypted communication stream.</description></item><item><title>OECD Guidelines for Cryptography Policy</title><link>/entries/41/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/41/</guid><description>Authors: OECD

Abstract: A variety of &amp;ldquo;key recovery,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;key escrow,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;trusted third-party&amp;rdquo; encryption requirements have been suggested in recent years by government agencies seeking to conduct covert surveillance within the changing environments brought about by new technologies. This report examines the fundamental properties of these requirements and attempts to outline the technical risks, costs, and implications of deploying systems that provide government access to encryption keys.</description></item><item><title>U.S. Relaxes Export Controls on Supercomputers</title><link>/entries/18/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/18/</guid><description>Authors: Howard Diamond
