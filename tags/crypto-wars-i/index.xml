Abstract: An editorial contends that the new White House proposal to keep high-powered encryption software out of the hands of foreign terrorists and criminals is needlessly restrictive and probably unworkable. The editorial says that the technology, which is legal in the US, is a good way for honest citizens to prevent crime and should be disseminated domestically and abroad.</description></item><item><title>A “Stumbling” US Encryption Policy</title><link>/entries/96/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/96/</guid><description>Authors: Madsen, Wayne

Abstract: “Are those in opposition to the administration&amp;rsquo;s [encryption] policy prepared to sacrifice public safety in the interests of commercial gain?” Those words, uttered by Deputy Assistant Attorney General Robert Litt, would etch themselves in the minds of those who attended the 7 May 1977 House International Economic Policy and Trade hearing on “Encryption: Individual Rights vs National Security”. The hearing was held to consider Representative Bob Goodlatte&amp;rsquo;s liberalized encryption export bill.</description></item><item><title>Another Faulty Encryption Policy</title><link>/entries/94/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/94/</guid><description>Published: December 1996

Abstract: Almost twenty years ago, a hostile debate over whether government could regulate encryption—later named the Crypto Wars—seized the country. At the center of this debate stirred one simple question: is encryption protected speech? This issue touched all branches of government percolating from Congress, to the President, and eventually to the federal courts. In a waterfall of cases, several United States Court of Appeals appeared to reach a consensus that encryption was protected speech under the First Amendment, and with that the Crypto Wars appeared to be over, until now.</description></item><item><title>Encryption Policy for the 21st Century: A Future Without Government-Prescribed Key Recovery</title><link>/entries/64/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/64/</guid><description>Authors: Singleton, Solveig

Abstract: In 1993, the US Government proposed a novel (and highly controversial) approach to cryptography, called key escrow. Key escrow cryptosystems used standard symmetric- and public- key ciphers, key management techniques and protocols, but with one added feature: a copy of the current session key, itself encrypted with a key known to the government, was sent at the beginning of every encrypted communication stream.</description></item><item><title>Revision to Encryption Items - Bureau of Export Administration</title><link>/entries/44/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/44/</guid><description>Authors: Bureau of Export Administration

Abstract: The controversial Escrowed Encryption Standard, recently adopted as a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS), has polarized some stakeholders both within and outside government and has also raised disturbing questions about the role of Federal agencies in the standards-setting process. This article explores the relationship between standards and Federal information policy and examines the balance between national security and law enforcement concerns, on the one hand, and privacy rights and U.</description></item><item><title>Statement of Cindy A.

Abstract: A variety of &amp;ldquo;key recovery,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;key escrow,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;trusted third-party&amp;rdquo; encryption requirements have been suggested in recent years by government agencies seeking to conduct covert surveillance within the changing environments brought about by new technologies. This report examines the fundamental properties of these requirements and attempts to outline the technical risks, costs, and implications of deploying systems that provide government access to encryption keys.</description></item><item><title>U.S. Supercomputer Export Control Policy</title><link>/entries/12/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/12/</guid><description>Authors: House of Representatives, Committee on National Security, Chairman, Hon.
