Abstract: This editorial in the New York Times argues that the Clinton Administration’s proposal to prevent the dissemination of encryption software to terrorists or criminals was both unworkable and presented risks to US commerce. The article discusses how industry and public interest advocates rejected the Administration’s proposals based on concerns about censorship, and the unworkability of the plan on practical grounds, including foreign unwillingness to acquiesce to potential surveillance by the U.</description></item><item><title>A “Stumbling” US Encryption Policy</title><link>/entries/a-stumbling-us-encryption-policy-872ec273/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/a-stumbling-us-encryption-policy-872ec273/</guid><description>Authors: Madsen, Wayne

Abstract: This article describes a 1997 hearing in the House of Representatives to discuss the SAFE Act, which would relax US encryption export controls. Administration officials sought to defend current key recovery policies and differentiate them from the Clipper Chip, while Representatives criticized them as unworkable, due to the necessary international cooperation. In discussing the SAFE ACT, industry representatives largely supported the bill and urged for minimal government restrictions.</description></item><item><title>Another Faulty Encryption Policy</title><link>/entries/another-faulty-encryption-policy-092ca4e3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/another-faulty-encryption-policy-092ca4e3/</guid><description>Published: December 1996

Abstract: This law review article by Peter Swire and Kenesa Ahmad discusses changes to Indian and Chinese encryption laws. The article begins by describing the development of U.S. encryption laws, mainly focusing on the crypto wars and the United States&amp;rsquo; eventual embrace of encryption. However, the article then discusses globalization that has taken place since the 1990s, and how policy positions developed during the crypto wars are no longer sufficient when considering the increased interconnectedness of the world.</description></item><item><title>Encryption and the Press Clause</title><link>/entries/encryption-and-the-press-clause-46f389c7/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/encryption-and-the-press-clause-46f389c7/</guid><description>Authors: Baranetsky, D Victoria

Abstract: In November of 1998, Solveig Singleton, Director of Information Studies at the Cato Institute, published this paper to provide a historical backdrop, comprehensive analysis of the current debates, forecast of future developments, and suggestions for United States encryption policy. Singleton stressed the importance of “very strong encryption,” denounced U.S. regulations and proposals seeking to limit development and exportation of encryption products, highlighted the implausibility of key-recovery infrastructure, and predicted a future where the entire regulation apparatus fails due to the development of a gray market in non-escrow encryption products.</description></item><item><title>Exploring Encryption and Potential Mechanisms for Authorized Government Access to Plaintext: Proceedings of a Workshop</title><link>/entries/exploring-encryption-and-potential-mechanisms-for-26c5994f/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/exploring-encryption-and-potential-mechanisms-for-26c5994f/</guid><description>Authors: Johnson, Anne and Eisenberg, Jon and Gumbling, Emily

Abstract: In 2011, Matt Blaze, of the University of Pennsylvania, published a retrospective paper on the key escrow cryptosystem and the Clipper Chip. The paper begins with a carrot and stick analogy on early 1990s encryption regulations. The stick, classification of encryption as a munition and its deterrent effect on incorporation of strong encryption in consumer products. The carrot, an exception for systems incorporating a backdoor (the key escrow system).</description></item><item><title>Request for Comments: Revisions to Encryption Items</title><link>/entries/request-for-comments-revisions-to-encryption-items-0c68d1bf/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/request-for-comments-revisions-to-encryption-items-0c68d1bf/</guid><description>Authors: Lewis, James A.
