Abstract: This article describes a 1997 hearing in the House of Representatives to discuss the SAFE Act, which would relax US encryption export controls. Administration officials sought to defend current key recovery policies and differentiate them from the Clipper Chip, while Representatives criticized them as unworkable, due to the necessary international cooperation. In discussing the SAFE ACT, industry representatives largely supported the bill and urged for minimal government restrictions.</description></item><item><title>Encryption Policy for the 21st Century: A Future Without Government-Prescribed Key Recovery</title><link>/entries/encryption-policy-for-the-21st-century-a-future-wi-516bac02/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/encryption-policy-for-the-21st-century-a-future-wi-516bac02/</guid><description>Authors: Singleton, Solveig

Abstract: In November of 1998, Solveig Singleton, Director of Information Studies at the Cato Institute, published this paper to provide a historical backdrop, comprehensive analysis of the current debates, forecast of future developments, and suggestions for United States encryption policy. Singleton stressed the importance of “very strong encryption,” denounced U.S. regulations and proposals seeking to limit development and exportation of encryption products, highlighted the implausibility of key-recovery infrastructure, and predicted a future where the entire regulation apparatus fails due to the development of a gray market in non-escrow encryption products.</description></item><item><title>The Risks of Key Recovery, Key Escrow, and Trusted Third-Party Encryption (Revised)</title><link>/entries/the-risks-of-key-recovery-key-escrow-and-trusted-t-50dad67f/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/the-risks-of-key-recovery-key-escrow-and-trusted-t-50dad67f/</guid><description>Authors: Abelson, H. and Anderson, R. and Bellovin, S.M. and Benaloh, J. and Blaze, M. and Diffie, W. and Gilmore, J. and Neumann, P.G. and Rivest, R.L. and Schiller, J.I. and Schneier, B.

Abstract: This report offers a detailed technical evaluation of the technical risks, costs, and policy implications of allowing government access to encryption keys. The article begins with the proposals that would benefit law enforcement officials, and the possibly insurmountable barriers to building such a system, and the details of the security risks and costs of such a system.</description></item></channel></rss>
