Abstract: This article from the Electronic Frontier Foundation discusses a bill proposed in the California state legislature that would require smartphones sold in the state to be capable of being decrypted by the manufacturer. The article discusses the concurrent Apple court case seeking decryption, and other similar legislation being proposed at the state and federal levels. The article argues that such measures are likely unconstitutional, but that they are also ineffective and impractical.</description></item></channel></rss>
