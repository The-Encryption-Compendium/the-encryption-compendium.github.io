Abstract: On March 16, 2018, Robin Wilton, Director of Internet Trust, published a paper – originally created as an internal memorandum for Internet Society CEO, Kathy Brown – detailing the key questions CEOs should ask technical experts to ensure encryption policy competency. The paper explores three key topics: (1) getting a snapshot of your organization’s crypto strategy and current states, (2) practical challenges of deployment and management, and (3) non-technical factors around risk mitigation and law enforcement access.</description></item></channel></rss>
