Abstract: In recent years, there has been a substantial amount of research on quantum computers â€“machines that exploit quantum mechanical phenomena to solve mathematical problems that are difficult or intractable for conventional computers. If large-scale quantum computers are ever built, they will be able to break many of the public-key cryptosystems currently in use.</description></item></channel></rss>
