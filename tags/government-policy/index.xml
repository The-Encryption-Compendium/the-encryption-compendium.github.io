Abstract: This report summarizes the impact of encryption on Canada’s economy, the government’s policy, and how the policy could or should develop. First, the report defines cryptography and describes its uses, then describes Canada’s current encryption policy. Next, the report defines the factors and considerations crucial to developing Canada’s policies, such as commerce, State necessity, civil liberties, technical security, and international policy. Finally, the report discusses the benefits and drawbacks of various policy approaches to encryption.</description></item><item><title>Cryptography's Role in Securing the Information Society</title><link>/entries/cryptography-s-role-in-securing-the-information-so-07be5799/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/cryptography-s-role-in-securing-the-information-so-07be5799/</guid><description>Published: 1996

Abstract: Cryptography&amp;rsquo;s Role in Securing the Information Society by the National Research Council is a large, in-depth report seeking to describe and define what the national policy on cryptography could be. The report first describes the vulnerabilities, needs, and markets for cryptography for businesses and individuals, as well as the need for access for governments. Next, the report describes policy instruments, such as export controls, escrowed encryption, the Clipper Chip, and internal federal government policies.</description></item><item><title>Deputy Attorney General Rod J.

Abstract: This speech by Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein at the Global Cyber Security Summit in 2017 argues that competitive forces lead technology companies and the makers of encrypted technologies to resist cooperation with law enforcement. The speech details global cybersecurity threats, and how government programs, such as the Department of Defense and Department of justice have developed programs to help counter cyber attacks.</description></item><item><title>DOJ Plans to Strike Against Encryption While the Techlash Iron Is Hot</title><link>/entries/doj-plans-to-strike-against-encryption-while-the-t-bdfdad83/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/doj-plans-to-strike-against-encryption-while-the-t-bdfdad83/</guid><description>Authors: Pfefferkorn, Riana

Abstract: This blog post by Riana Pfefferkorn argues that since 2016, the Department of Justice sought to capitalize on public anti-technology sentiment to weaken encryption. First, the article describes the political climate, shaped by the Apple v FBI case, the role of big tech in various privacy scandals and foreign interference in the 2016 election, and foreign legislation, particularly in Australia and the U.</description></item><item><title>McCaul’s Crypto Commission: First, Do No Harm</title><link>/entries/mccauls-crypto-commission-first-do-no-harm-478ce042/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/mccauls-crypto-commission-first-do-no-harm-478ce042/</guid><description>Authors: White, Nathan

Abstract: On March 2, 2016, AccessNow published an article about the proposed McCaul-Warner Encryption Commission, which would “create a bipartisan commission of experts to study the debate over encryption and provide recommendations for overcoming the current impasse.” The article notes that despite their good intentions, “the commission, as proposed, might not produce what” they expect. The proposal relies on “the assumption that people from both ‘sides’ of the debate have not already engaged with one another in good faith” when in fact they did in the 1990s and more recently.</description></item><item><title>Statement by Commerce Secretary William Daley Re: Administration encryption policy</title><link>/entries/statement-by-commerce-secretary-william-daley-re-a-f1d56237/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/statement-by-commerce-secretary-william-daley-re-a-f1d56237/</guid><description>Authors: Daley, William M.

Abstract: This article from 1996 details the Clinton Administration’s key escrow proposal, outlines the positions around key escrow, international approaches to key escrow, and argues that key escrow is an effective solution that should be implemented. The article argues that key escrow assists law enforcement, protects businesses, would put the US in line with other nations, and can be securely implemented in up to 64 bit encryption.</description></item><item><title>Timeline: The U.S. Government and Cybersecurity</title><link>/entries/timeline-the-u-s-government-and-cybersecurity-5f7be48e/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/timeline-the-u-s-government-and-cybersecurity-5f7be48e/</guid><description>Published: May 2003
