Abstract: This technical article discusses an encryption method where revealing an encryption key does not reveal the corresponding decryption key. This article proposes and explains a public-key cryptosystem that would not require a courier to carry the key. Further, the article explains its uses in the context of email, and how it would allow communications to be secure and private.</description></item><item><title>CEOs and Encryption: The Questions You Need to Ask Your Experts</title><link>/entries/ceos-and-encryption-the-questions-you-need-to-ask-f054d98f/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/ceos-and-encryption-the-questions-you-need-to-ask-f054d98f/</guid><description>Authors: Wilton, Robin

Abstract: On March 16, 2018, Robin Wilton, Director of Internet Trust, published a paper – originally created as an internal memorandum for Internet Society CEO, Kathy Brown – detailing the key questions CEOs should ask technical experts to ensure encryption policy competency. The paper explores three key topics: (1) getting a snapshot of your organization’s crypto strategy and current states, (2) practical challenges of deployment and management, and (3) non-technical factors around risk mitigation and law enforcement access.</description></item><item><title>Status Report on the First Round of the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Process</title><link>/entries/status-report-on-the-first-round-of-the-nist-post-579fe6e3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/status-report-on-the-first-round-of-the-nist-post-579fe6e3/</guid><description>Authors: Alagic, Gorjan and Alperin-Sheriff, Jacob and Apon, Daniel and Cooper, David and Dang, Quynh and Liu, Yi-Kai and Miller, Carl and Moody, Dustin and Peralta, Rene and Perlner, Ray and Robinson, Angela and Smith-Tone, Daniel

Abstract: The National Institute of Standards and Technology is in the process of selecting one or more public-key cryptographic algorithms through a public competition-like process. The new publickey cryptography standards will specify one or more additional digital signature, public-key encryption, and key-establishment algorithms to augment FIPS 186-4, Digital Signature Standard (DSS), as well as special publications SP 800-56A Revision 2, Recommendation for Pair-Wise Key Establishment Schemes Using Discrete Logarithm Cryptography, and SP 800-56B, Recommendation for Pair-Wise Key-Establishment Schemes Using Integer Factorization.</description></item></channel></rss>
