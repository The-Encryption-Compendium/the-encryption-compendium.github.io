Abstract: On July 27, 2016, the Yale Law Journal Forum published a short essay that agrees in part and disagrees in part with Robert Litt’s, General Counsel of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, “new analysis for the Fourth Amendment in the Information Age”.

Abstract: In Colorado v. Davis, the Colorado Supreme Court held that using a passcode given to police officers to execute a search warrant on a smartphone did not violate the Fourth Amendment. In this case, a criminal defendant had given his cellphone passcode to police officers during his arrest so they could call his girlfriend. Later, after law enforcement received a warrant to search the phone, the passcode was used to search the phone.</description></item></channel></rss>
