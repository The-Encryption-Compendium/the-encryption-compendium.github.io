Tags: 2010s Backdoors Economic Impact Human Rights National Security Abstract: We urge you to reject any proposal that U.S. companies deliberately weaken the security of their products. We request that the White House instead focus on developing policies that will promote rather than undermine the wide adoption of strong encryption technology. Such policies will in turn help to promote and protect cybersecurity, economic growth, and human rights, both here and abroad.</description></item><item><title>Dutch Government Backs Uncrackable Encryption</title><link>/entries/149/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/149/</guid><description>Authors: Robert Hackett
