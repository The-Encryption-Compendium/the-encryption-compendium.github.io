Abstract: We urge you to reject any proposal that U.S. companies deliberately weaken the security of their products. We request that the White House instead focus on developing policies that will promote rather than undermine the wide adoption of strong encryption technology. Such policies will in turn help to promote and protect cybersecurity, economic growth, and human rights, both here and abroad.</description></item><item><title>Dutch Government Backs Uncrackable Encryption</title><link>/entries/dutch-government-backs-uncrackable-encryption-5378035f/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/dutch-government-backs-uncrackable-encryption-5378035f/</guid><description>Authors: Robert Hackett

Abstract: U.S. government agencies have identified the inability to access information on encrypted mobile phones as one of the largest current challenges to criminal investigations. In September 2017, Access Now, supported by the Mozilla Foundation’s Tech Policy Fellowship, hosted the Crypto Colloquium — an invite-only dialogue, with participation under the Chatham House rules — to discuss this challenge. Participants represented four stakeholder groups: civil society, academic experts, technology companies, and former U.</description></item><item><title>Encryption, Biometrics, and the Status Quo Ante</title><link>/entries/encryption-biometrics-and-the-status-quo-ante-5e5d3458/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/encryption-biometrics-and-the-status-quo-ante-5e5d3458/</guid><description>Authors: Rosenzweig, Paul

Abstract: As the recent indirect debate between FBI Director James Comey and co-blogger Susan Landau makes clear, the underlying premises of the encryption issue are highly contested. The Senate will continue the debate this week with a hearing before the Judiciary Committee on July 8 at which our own Herb Lin (among others) will testify and another hearing before the Intelligence Committee.</description></item><item><title>Ex-NSA Chief Thinks the Government is Dead Wrong in Asking Apple for a Backdoor</title><link>/entries/ex-nsa-chief-thinks-the-government-is-dead-wrong-i-ec6184f2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/ex-nsa-chief-thinks-the-government-is-dead-wrong-i-ec6184f2/</guid><description>Authors: pzdupe2

Abstract: Recently, U.S. law enforcement officials have re-energized their push for a technical means to bypass encryption. But seeking to undermine encryption only looks backward instead of focusing on where technology is going. We should be having conversations about new investigative techniques, not trying to preserve the access enjoyed in the days before encryption was so widespread, particularly when so much is at stake in doing so.</description></item></channel></rss>
