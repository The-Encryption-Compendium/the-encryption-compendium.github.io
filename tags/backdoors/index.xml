Abstract: As the recent indirect debate between FBI Director James Comey and co-blogger Susan Landau makes clear, the underlying premises of the encryption issue are highly contested. The Senate will continue the debate this week with a hearing before the Judiciary Committee on July 8 at which our own Herb Lin (among others) will testify and another hearing before the Intelligence Committee.</description></item><item><title>FBI blasts Apple, Google for locking police out of phones</title><link>/entries/82/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/82/</guid><description>Authors: Craig Timberg and Greg Miller

Abstract: Whether the FBI and NSA have the legal authority to obtain the master keys that companies use for Web encryption remains an open question, but it hasn&amp;rsquo;t stopped the U.S. government from trying.</description></item><item><title>Holder urges tech companies to leave device backdoors open for police</title><link>/entries/79/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/79/</guid><description>Published: September 2014

Abstract: Twenty years ago, law enforcement organizations lobbied to require data and communication services to engineer their products to guarantee law enforcement access to all data. After lengthy debate and vigorous predictions of enforcement channels “going dark,” these attempts to regulate the emerging Internet were abandoned. In the intervening years, innovation on the Internet ﬂourished, and law enforcement agencies found new and more eﬀective means of accessing vastly larger quantities of data.</description></item><item><title>Old Technopanic in New iBottles</title><link>/entries/78/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/78/</guid><description>Authors: Julian Sanchez

Abstract: The US Government has been busy on the encryption front in both positive and negative ways.
