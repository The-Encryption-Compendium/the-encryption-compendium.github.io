Abstract: This declassified report outlines the development of encryption technology by the United States government, and how private actors have challenged the government’s monopoly and changed the landscape of encryption. The report begins by detailing the creation of the NSA and the development of cryptography and provides a timeline through key escrow in the 1990s. The article ends by proposing potential paths for the future of cryptography and urging the Clinton Administration to seek an international resolution to require key escrow registration to allow governments a back door while preventing foreign technology as an alternative to complying with American requirements.</description></item></channel></rss>
