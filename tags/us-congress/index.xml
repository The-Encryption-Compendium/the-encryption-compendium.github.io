Abstract: Alan Z. Rozenshtein, Associate Professor of Law at the University of Minnesota Law School, warns of the dangers of forgoing end-to-end encryption, an anticipated consequence of the powers granted to the attorney general, in the circulating draft of the EARN IT Act. Rozenshtein argues, “the question of whether to permit ubiquitous encryption is the sort of high-level policy decision that is best handled not by the executive branch but by Congress,” recommends against the legislature “shirk[ing] its responsibility to make this tough decision,” and, in the context of the Act, calls for the exclusion of anything encryption-related from the list of best practices.</description></item><item><title>H.R. 2545 - Data Breach Prevention and Compensation Act of 2019</title><link>/entries/h-r-2545-data-breach-prevention-and-compensation-a-2d6fd580/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/h-r-2545-data-breach-prevention-and-compensation-a-2d6fd580/</guid><description>Authors: Cummings, Elijah E. and Krishnamoorthi, Raja

Abstract: On May 7, 2019, Representatives Cummings and Krishnamoorthi introduced H.R. 2545, the Data Breach Prevention and Compensation Act of 2019. H.R. 2545 sought to create an Office of Cybersecurity at the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for “supervision of data security at consumer reporting agencies, to require the promulgation of regulations establishing standards for effective cybersecurity for effective cybersecurity at consumer reporting agencies, to impose penalties on credit reporting agencies for cybersecurity breaches that put sensitive consumer data at risk, and for other purposes.</description></item><item><title>H.R. 4170 - Ensuring National Constitutional Rights for Your Private Telecommunications Act of 2019</title><link>/entries/h-r-4170-ensuring-national-constitutional-rights-f-808a9c8d/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/h-r-4170-ensuring-national-constitutional-rights-f-808a9c8d/</guid><description>Authors: Lieu, Ted and DelBene, Suzan and Jordan, Jim

Abstract: The ENCRYPT Act of 2019, introduced into the Senate with bipartisan support, seeks to preempt state and local governments from compelling private companies to weaken encryption or insert backdoors. Therefore, this bill would make encryption policy the subject of federal law and out of the hands of state and local lawmakers.</description></item><item><title>H.R. 4943 - Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act</title><link>/entries/h-r-4943-clarifying-lawful-overseas-use-of-data-ac-f1395da4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/h-r-4943-clarifying-lawful-overseas-use-of-data-ac-f1395da4/</guid><description>Authors: Collins, Doug

Abstract: On February 6, 2018, Representatives Collins, Jeffries, Issa, DelBene, Marino, Rutherford and Demings introduced H.R. 4943, the “Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act” or the “CLOUD Act.” H.R. 4943 amends title 18 of the United States federal criminal code to “improve law enforcement access to data stored across borders, and for other purposes.” The bill requires electronic communication service (ECS) and remote computer service (RCS) providers to comply with existing preservation, backup and disclosure requirements pertaining to contents of electronic communications and any record or other information pertaining to a customer or subscriber within their possession, regardless of whether the information is located within the United States.</description></item><item><title>H.R. 4978 - Online Privacy Act of 2019</title><link>/entries/h-r-4978-online-privacy-act-of-2019-7c0e40e7/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/h-r-4978-online-privacy-act-of-2019-7c0e40e7/</guid><description>Authors: Eshoo, Anna G. and Lofgren, Zoe

Abstract: On November 5, 2019, Representatives Eshoo and Lofgren introduced H.R. 4978, the Online Privacy Act of 2019. H.R. 4978 sought to incorporate elements of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) into federal law. As such, the bill aimed to “provide for individual rights relating to privacy of personal information, to establish privacy and security requirements for covered entities relating to personal information, and to establish an agency to be known as the United States Digital Privacy Agency to enforce such rights and requirements, and for other purposes.</description></item><item><title>Information Security and Privacy in Network Environments</title><link>/entries/information-security-and-privacy-in-network-enviro-73af6c6d/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/information-security-and-privacy-in-network-enviro-73af6c6d/</guid><description>Authors: Computing Technologies Program (Joan Winston) Telecommunications

Abstract: This blog post outlines the argument that proposed legislation entitled the EARN IT Act is unconstitutional on Fourth Amendment Grounds. The Post argues that the Act would require online service providers to actively scan for Child Sexual Abuse Materials, rather than merely reporting it when it is found. By requiring providers to conduct these searches, the providers would become state actors and the searches would require a warrant, and without a warrant, these searches would be unconstitutional under the fourth amendment, and the evidence would be excluded in court proceedings.</description></item></channel></rss>
