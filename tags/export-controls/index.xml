Abstract: An editorial contends that the new White House proposal to keep high-powered encryption software out of the hands of foreign terrorists and criminals is needlessly restrictive and probably unworkable. The editorial says that the technology, which is legal in the US, is a good way for honest citizens to prevent crime and should be disseminated domestically and abroad.</description></item><item><title>A “Stumbling” US Encryption Policy</title><link>/entries/a-stumbling-us-encryption-policy-f35f29c1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/a-stumbling-us-encryption-policy-f35f29c1/</guid><description>Authors: Madsen, Wayne

Abstract: “Are those in opposition to the administration&amp;rsquo;s [encryption] policy prepared to sacrifice public safety in the interests of commercial gain?” Those words, uttered by Deputy Assistant Attorney General Robert Litt, would etch themselves in the minds of those who attended the 7 May 1977 House International Economic Policy and Trade hearing on “Encryption: Individual Rights vs National Security”. The hearing was held to consider Representative Bob Goodlatte&amp;rsquo;s liberalized encryption export bill.</description></item><item><title>Another Faulty Encryption Policy</title><link>/entries/another-faulty-encryption-policy-fe20dccf/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/another-faulty-encryption-policy-fe20dccf/</guid><description>Published: December 1996

Abstract: As the 21st century approaches, encryption is presenting a national security dilemma in the US. While the use of strong encryption for computerized data is essential in protecting our nation, widespread, unregulated encryption poses serious problems on two levels: encryption could inhibit the government&amp;rsquo;s ability to enforce the law as well as gather foreign intelligence. As a result, the government has established export controls on encryption products and proposed a &amp;lsquo;key recovery&amp;rsquo; system designed to enable law enforcement officers to access encrypted data in the course of lawful investigations.</description></item><item><title>Executive Order 13026 - Administration of Export Controls on Encryption Products</title><link>/entries/executive-order-13026-administration-of-export-con-59e2a7fe/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/executive-order-13026-administration-of-export-con-59e2a7fe/</guid><description>Published: November 1996</description></item><item><title>First and Fifth Amendment Challenges to Export Controls on Encryption: Bernstein and Karn</title><link>/entries/first-and-fifth-amendment-challenges-to-export-con-4c23d434/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/first-and-fifth-amendment-challenges-to-export-con-4c23d434/</guid><description>Authors: Pilkington, Laura M.

Abstract: In light of the end of the Cold War, members of the former COCOM export control regime recognized that COCOM’s East-West focus was no longer the appropriate basis for export controls. There was a need to establish a new arrangement to deal with risks to regional and international security and stability related to the spread … Continued</description></item><item><title>U.S. Relaxes Export Controls on Supercomputers</title><link>/entries/u-s-relaxes-export-controls-on-supercomputers-953143cc/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/u-s-relaxes-export-controls-on-supercomputers-953143cc/</guid><description>Authors: Diamond, Howard

Abstract: This paper reviews the most recent changes to the US export controls on encryption items (referred to herein as the “US Regulations”) that were published in the US Federal Register on 19 October, 2000.1165 Fed. Reg. 62600 (2000). It describes how the decision by the European Union (EU) Council of Ministers on 22 June 2000, to create a license free zone for exports of encryption (and other) items (referred to herein as the “EU Regulations”) provided the initial stimulus for these changes.</description></item><item><title>US Government Fines Intel's Wind River Over Crypto Exports</title><link>/entries/us-government-fines-intel-s-wind-river-over-crypto-92b31bae/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/us-government-fines-intel-s-wind-river-over-crypto-92b31bae/</guid><description>Authors: Leyden, John

Abstract: The Wassenaar Arrangement (WA), the first global multilateral arrangement on export controls for conventional weapons and sensitive dual-use goods and technologies, received final approval by 33 co-founding countries in July 1996 and began operations in September 1996. The WA was designed to promote transparency, exchange of views and information and greater responsibility in transfers of … Continued</description></item></channel></rss>
