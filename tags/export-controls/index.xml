Abstract: As the 21st century approaches, encryption is presenting a national security dilemma in the US. While the use of strong encryption for computerized data is essential in protecting our nation, widespread, unregulated encryption poses serious problems on two levels: encryption could inhibit the government&amp;rsquo;s ability to enforce the law as well as gather foreign intelligence. As a result, the government has established export controls on encryption products and proposed a &amp;lsquo;key recovery&amp;rsquo; system designed to enable law enforcement officers to access encrypted data in the course of lawful investigations.</description></item><item><title>Executive Order 13026 - Administration of Export Controls on Encryption Products</title><link>/entries/138/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/138/</guid><description>Authors: President Clinton

Abstract: In light of the end of the Cold War, members of the former COCOM export control regime recognized that COCOM’s East-West focus was no longer the appropriate basis for export controls. There was a need to establish a new arrangement to deal with risks to regional and international security and stability related to the spread … Continued</description></item><item><title>Paper on Codes Is Sent Despite U.S. Objections</title><link>/entries/111/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/111/</guid><description>Authors: John Markoff

Abstract: This paper reviews the most recent changes to the US export controls on encryption items (referred to herein as the “US Regulations”) that were published in the US Federal Register on 19 October, 2000.1165 Fed. Reg. 62600 (2000). It describes how the decision by the European Union (EU) Council of Ministers on 22 June 2000, to create a license free zone for exports of encryption (and other) items (referred to herein as the “EU Regulations”) provided the initial stimulus for these changes.</description></item><item><title>US government fines Intel's Wind River over crypto exports</title><link>/entries/130/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/130/</guid><description>Authors: John Leyden
