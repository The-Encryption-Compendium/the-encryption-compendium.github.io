Abstract: An editorial contends that the new White House proposal to keep high-powered encryption software out of the hands of foreign terrorists and criminals is needlessly restrictive and probably unworkable. The editorial says that the technology, which is legal in the US, is a good way for honest citizens to prevent crime and should be disseminated domestically and abroad.</description></item><item><title>A Roadmap for Exceptional Access Research</title><link>/entries/a-roadmap-for-exceptional-access-research-9b867071/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/a-roadmap-for-exceptional-access-research-9b867071/</guid><description>Authors: Varia, Mayank

Abstract: “Are those in opposition to the administration&amp;rsquo;s [encryption] policy prepared to sacrifice public safety in the interests of commercial gain?” Those words, uttered by Deputy Assistant Attorney General Robert Litt, would etch themselves in the minds of those who attended the 7 May 1977 House International Economic Policy and Trade hearing on “Encryption: Individual Rights vs National Security”. The hearing was held to consider Representative Bob Goodlatte&amp;rsquo;s liberalized encryption export bill.</description></item><item><title>Another Faulty Encryption Policy</title><link>/entries/another-faulty-encryption-policy-092ca4e3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/another-faulty-encryption-policy-092ca4e3/</guid><description>Published: December 1996

Abstract: Attacks of Sept 11 renew debate on how strongly public&amp;ndash;and by extension terrorists and other criminals&amp;ndash;should be able to encrypt their electronic messages; technology of scrambling data and messages has become crucial element of computer security for businesses and consumers; officials of law enforcement and intelligence agencies have long warned lawmakers that they were unable to break strongest encryption products, and that crimes eventually would be committed that might otherwise have been prevented; FBI has not said publicly whether hijackers who attacked World Trade Center and Pentagon even used encryption to cloak their communications; Philip R Zimmermann, creator of popular encryption programs, known as PGP, says he would be surprised if this were not case; Sen Judd Gregg says he will not make specific legislative proposal until he sees what Atty Gen John Ashcroft includes in final version of his broad anti-terrorism bill; says he wants to see legislation to order encryption companies that sell products in US to include back door that would allow government access when terrorist uses encyption (M)</description></item><item><title>Doomed to Repeat History?

Published: 2017
Abstract: Almost twenty years ago, a hostile debate over whether government could regulate encryption—later named the Crypto Wars—seized the country. At the center of this debate stirred one simple question: is encryption protected speech? This issue touched all branches of government percolating from Congress, to the President, and eventually to the federal courts. In a waterfall of cases, several United States Court of Appeals appeared to reach a consensus that encryption was protected speech under the First Amendment, and with that the Crypto Wars appeared to be over, until now.</description></item><item><title>Encryption Export Controls</title><link>/entries/encryption-export-controls-1714ec24/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/encryption-export-controls-1714ec24/</guid><description>Authors: Grimmett, Jeanne J.

Abstract: In 1993, the US Government proposed a novel (and highly controversial) approach to cryptography, called key escrow. Key escrow cryptosystems used standard symmetric- and public- key ciphers, key management techniques and protocols, but with one added feature: a copy of the current session key, itself encrypted with a key known to the government, was sent at the beginning of every encrypted communication stream.</description></item><item><title>Request for Comments: Revisions to Encryption Items</title><link>/entries/request-for-comments-revisions-to-encryption-items-0c68d1bf/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/request-for-comments-revisions-to-encryption-items-0c68d1bf/</guid><description>Authors: Lewis, James A.

Abstract: The controversial Escrowed Encryption Standard, recently adopted as a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS), has polarized some stakeholders both within and outside government and has also raised disturbing questions about the role of Federal agencies in the standards-setting process. This article explores the relationship between standards and Federal information policy and examines the balance between national security and law enforcement concerns, on the one hand, and privacy rights and U.</description></item><item><title>Statement by Commerce Secretary William Daley Re: Administration encryption policy</title><link>/entries/statement-by-commerce-secretary-william-daley-re-a-f1d56237/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/statement-by-commerce-secretary-william-daley-re-a-f1d56237/</guid><description>Authors: Daley, William M.
