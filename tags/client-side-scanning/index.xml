Abstract: Paul Rosenzweig, former Deputy Assistant Secretary for Policy in the Department of Homeland Security, and founder of a homeland security consulting company, writes an analysis of client-side scanning published by the Lawfare Institute in cooperation with the Brookings Institute. He concludes that, while client-side scanning offers attractive protective capabilities to meet the rise of online-distributed child pornography via encrypted systems, its adoption at its current nascent stage would be nonetheless undesirable due to technological, legal, and policy uncertainties.</description></item></channel></rss>
