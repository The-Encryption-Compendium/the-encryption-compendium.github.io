Abstract: This report summarizes the impact of encryption on Canada’s economy, the government’s policy, and how the policy could or should develop. First, the report defines cryptography and describes its uses, then describes Canada’s current encryption policy. Next, the report defines the factors and considerations crucial to developing Canada’s policies, such as commerce, State necessity, civil liberties, technical security, and international policy. Finally, the report discusses the benefits and drawbacks of various policy approaches to encryption.</description></item><item><title>Canada's Quiet Weakening of Communications Encryption</title><link>/entries/canada-s-quiet-weakening-of-communications-encrypt-c6650006/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/canada-s-quiet-weakening-of-communications-encrypt-c6650006/</guid><description>Authors: Parsons, Christopher and Israel, Tamir

Abstract: This article by Christopher Parsons argues that a 2019 Canadian ministerial communique weakens encryption. First, the article provides background on the history of Canadian encryption policy and the 2019 ministerial communique, and how its proposed policy would weaken encryption and require that private companies add backdoors for the Canadian government. Next, the article details the government&amp;rsquo;s justifications for the policy, and how they fail to justify the weakening of encryption.</description></item><item><title>Encryption Policy a Crowd Pleaser</title><link>/entries/encryption-policy-a-crowd-pleaser-eae182e4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/encryption-policy-a-crowd-pleaser-eae182e4/</guid><description>Authors: Leiper, Jeff

Abstract: In November of 1998, Jeff Leiper, of Silicon Valley North, wrote regarding the Canadian government’s recently instituted encryption policy and the resulting widespread approval of the private sector. Leiper explained that despite considerable exploration of potential restrictions on encryption, including a proposed requirement to keep keys in third-party escrow for law enforcement access, the Canadian government ultimately decided to institute a policy of business sector self-regulation, which imposed no restrictions on the development, importation or use of encryption products.</description></item><item><title>Lawful Access – Consultation Document</title><link>/entries/lawful-access-consultation-document-a8b104aa/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/lawful-access-consultation-document-a8b104aa/</guid><description>Published: August 2002

Abstract: On August 25, 2002, the Canadian Department of Justice published a consultation document on Lawful Access, an “important and well-established technique used by law enforcement and national security agencies to conduct investigations” involving the interception of communications and search and seizure of information pursuant to legislative and criminal code authorizations. The Department of Justice described tool as essential in the “prevention, investigation and prosecution of serious offences and the investigation of threats to the security of Canada.</description></item><item><title>Shining a Light on the Encryption Debate: A Canadian Field Guide</title><link>/entries/shining-a-light-on-the-encryption-debate-a-canadia-9d78aca2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/shining-a-light-on-the-encryption-debate-a-canadia-9d78aca2/</guid><description>Authors: Gill, Lex and Parsons, Christopher and Israel, Tamir

Abstract: This report from Lawfare details a summit of law enforcement officials from the Five Eyes intelligence alliance—made up of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States—and argues that the rhetoric espoused was far less troubling than it seemed. At the summit, Australian officials detailed an aggressive stance against encryption. However, by ignoring technical realities, the policy proposals are rendered toothless.</description></item></channel></rss>
