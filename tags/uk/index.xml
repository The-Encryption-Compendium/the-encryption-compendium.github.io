Abstract: In 1997, Nigel Hickson, of the Communications and Information Industries Directorate at the UK Government’s Department of Trade and Industry, wrote to provide a business and economics perspective on the ongoing international debates regarding information security and encryption. Hickson emphasized that the Department of Trade and Industry must play a role in the debate by educating end users, producing appropriate guidance and advice standards, and in representing the views of industry in national and international debates on the issue.</description></item></channel></rss>
