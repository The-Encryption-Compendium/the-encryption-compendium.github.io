Abstract: Recently, only secret government agencies were concerned about cryptography. It now is an important matter for many individuals and businesses who use the Internet. That has led to an intense effort on the part of several governmental agencies to control cryptography. This article provides an explanation of the evolution of cryptography, a synopsis of the evolving cryptography debate, an examination of the different interests represented within the debate and a framework for analyzing the First Amendment issues that are involved.</description></item><item><title>Encryption and the Press Clause</title><link>/entries/encryption-and-the-press-clause-46f389c7/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/encryption-and-the-press-clause-46f389c7/</guid><description>Authors: Baranetsky, D Victoria

Abstract: Almost twenty years ago, a hostile debate over whether government could regulate encryption—later named the Crypto Wars—seized the country. At the center of this debate stirred one simple question: is encryption protected speech? This issue touched all branches of government percolating from Congress, to the President, and eventually to the federal courts. In a waterfall of cases, several United States Court of Appeals appeared to reach a consensus that encryption was protected speech under the First Amendment, and with that the Crypto Wars appeared to be over, until now.</description></item><item><title>Encryption Export Controls</title><link>/entries/encryption-export-controls-1714ec24/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/encryption-export-controls-1714ec24/</guid><description>Authors: Grimmett, Jeanne J.
