Abstract: In September of 2016, at the request of the public safety community, the Federal Partnership for Interoperable Communications (FPIC), produced a report on the key reasons, implications, and considerations associated with the encryption of critical portions of public safety communication systems. Among the key considerations for policy and stakeholders were what to encrypt; how to encrypt; the impact on Interoperability; public information access; and general cost considerations.</description></item><item><title>Guidelines for Encryption in Land Mobile Radio Systems</title><link>/entries/guidelines-for-encryption-in-land-mobile-radio-sys-b0ed6104/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/guidelines-for-encryption-in-land-mobile-radio-sys-b0ed6104/</guid><description>Published: February 2016

Abstract: On February 8, 2016, the Federal Partnership for Interoperable Communications (FPIC) published guidelines for encryption in land mobile radio (LRM) systems for state, local, and tribal public safety entities. The report discusses the background of public safety entities and encryption, high-level technical information about encryption, types of encryption algorithms for public safety, cryptographic algorithms, and issues with interoperability. The goal of the guidelines was to get rid of confusion and competing information “regarding voice and data encryption” in LMR systems for the state, local, and tribal public safety entities.</description></item></channel></rss>
