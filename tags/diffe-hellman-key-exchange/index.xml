Abstract: In November 1976, Whitfield Diffie and Martin E. Hellman, of the Stanford University Department of Electrical Engineering, wrote regarding potential solutions to the need for new cryptographic systems which minimize the necessity of secure key distribution channels and supply the equivalent of a written signature. The paper noted that then-contemporary cryptography imposed such severe inconveniences on the system users (namely, the need to transfer keys prior to initially communicating) that it entirely nullified the benefits of teleprocessing and acted as a disincentive for industry adoption.</description></item></channel></rss>
