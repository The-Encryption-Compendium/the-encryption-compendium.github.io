Abstract: On September 13, 2001, Wired published an article about the impact of 9/11 terrorist attacks on the encryption debate, and declared that “[t]he encryption wars have begun”. The article claims that the balance of the debate between privacy and security “abruptly shifted” in the wake of 9/11, and that “political winds have shifted from business to national security”. The article discusses various Clinton Administration initiatives related to encryption, and highlighted quotes from Congress members who “called for a global prohibition on encryption products without backdoors for government surveillance”.</description></item><item><title>Disputes on Electronic Message Encryption Take on New Urgency</title><link>/entries/disputes-on-electronic-message-encryption-take-on-6dfb72b1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/disputes-on-electronic-message-encryption-take-on-6dfb72b1/</guid><description>Authors: Schwartz, John

Abstract: This article, Disputes on Electronic Message Encryption Take on New Urgency, written by John Schwartz and published in the New York Times shortly after 9/11, describes how the attack on the World Trade Center, and the possibility that the attackers used encrypted communications in the planning and execution of the attack, renewed debate on law enforcement access to encrypted technologies. The article describes the applicability of key escrow and the Clipper Chip to accessing encrypted communications, and legislative proposals for access proposed in the days after 9/11.</description></item><item><title>Encryption and the Press Clause</title><link>/entries/encryption-and-the-press-clause-46f389c7/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/encryption-and-the-press-clause-46f389c7/</guid><description>Authors: Baranetsky, D Victoria

Abstract: This law review article by D. Victoria Baranetsky argues that, through a historical understanding of the purpose of the Press Clause, the First Amendment protects encryption technology. The article begins by describing the Framers’ intent and purpose in the Press Clause, as well as the traditional interpretations and debates that have arisen surrounding its meaning, then goes on to describe how those interpretations may interact with and protect encryption.</description></item><item><title>Exploring Encryption and Potential Mechanisms for Authorized Government Access to Plaintext: Proceedings of a Workshop</title><link>/entries/exploring-encryption-and-potential-mechanisms-for-26c5994f/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/exploring-encryption-and-potential-mechanisms-for-26c5994f/</guid><description>Authors: Johnson, Anne and Eisenberg, Jon and Gumbling, Emily

Abstract: On June 23-24, 2016, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine held a “Workshop on Encryption and Mechanisms for Authorized Government Access to Plaintext”. In September 2016, The National Academies Press published a book which summarizes the “presentations and discussions” from the workshop. Participants discussed encryption mechanisms that “would enable access to plaintext information by law enforcement or national security agencies with appropriate authority.</description></item><item><title>Senator Backs Off Backdoors</title><link>/entries/senator-backs-off-backdoors-b6e3901e/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/senator-backs-off-backdoors-b6e3901e/</guid><description>Authors: McCullagh, Declan

Abstract: A senator changes his mind after calling for a prohibition on data-scrambling products without backdoors for government surveillance. Now, he &amp;ldquo;has no intentions&amp;rdquo; of working on such an encryption bill. Declan McCullagh reports from Washington.</description></item><item><title>Techies Urge Senator To Drop Encryption Key Plan</title><link>/entries/techies-urge-senator-to-drop-encryption-key-plan-7c42e2b5/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/techies-urge-senator-to-drop-encryption-key-plan-7c42e2b5/</guid><description>Authors: Brian Krebs

Abstract: This article details a letter sent by privacy advocates to Senator Judd Gregg in response to a speech he made days after September 11, condemning encryption. Senator Gregg called for quasi-judicial rulemaking requiring backdoors, stating that it was likely that the 9/11 attackers likely used encryption in emails to plan the attack. Meanwhile, advocates stressed the impracticality of requiring a back door, as well as the risk of holding all passwords in one central location, in case that is hacked.</description></item></channel></rss>
