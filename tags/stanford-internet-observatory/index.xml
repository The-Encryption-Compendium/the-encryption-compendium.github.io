Abstract: Modern-day online services are plagued by various kinds of harmful content, from hate speech to terrorist propaganda to depictions of the sexual abuse of children, to name just a few. Regulatorsâ€™ focus on content analysis overlooks the prevalence and utility of what this article calls content-oblivious techniques. This article presents the results of a survey about the trust and safety techniques employed by a group of online service providers, most of them communications services or services driven primarily by user-generated content.</description></item></channel></rss>
