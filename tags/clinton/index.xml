Abstract: Recently, only secret government agencies were concerned about cryptography. It now is an important matter for many individuals and businesses who use the Internet. That has led to an intense effort on the part of several governmental agencies to control cryptography. This article provides an explanation of the evolution of cryptography, a synopsis of the evolving cryptography debate, an examination of the different interests represented within the debate and a framework for analyzing the First Amendment issues that are involved.</description></item><item><title>Encryption Control 'Unconstitutional'</title><link>/entries/101/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/101/</guid><description>Authors: The Associated Press

Abstract: As the 21st century approaches, encryption is presenting a national security dilemma in the US. While the use of strong encryption for computerized data is essential in protecting our nation, widespread, unregulated encryption poses serious problems on two levels: encryption could inhibit the government&amp;rsquo;s ability to enforce the law as well as gather foreign intelligence. As a result, the government has established export controls on encryption products and proposed a &amp;lsquo;key recovery&amp;rsquo; system designed to enable law enforcement officers to access encrypted data in the course of lawful investigations.</description></item><item><title>Executive Order 13026 - Administration of Export Controls on Encryption Products</title><link>/entries/103/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/103/</guid><description>Authors: President Clinton
