Abstract: This speech by FBI Director James Comey, offered at the Brooking Institute in 2014, discusses the challenges that encryption and going dark present to law enforcement. Director Comey discusses how a proliferation in digital data and communication are increasingly encrypted, and how law enforcement is technologically incapable of keeping up. Further, CALEA is not equipped to offer fair access to newer forms of technology.</description></item><item><title>Prepared Statement by Senator Chuck Grassley, Hearing On “Going Dark: Encryption, Technology, and the Balance Between Public Safety and Privacy</title><link>/entries/prepared-statement-by-senator-chuck-grassley-heari-63a8fa1c/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/prepared-statement-by-senator-chuck-grassley-heari-63a8fa1c/</guid><description>Authors: Grassley, Chuck

Abstract: On July 8, 2015, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Chuck Grassley, addressed a Senate hearing, inquiring “whether recent technological changes have upset the balance between public safety and privacy.” Of particular focus for Senator Grassley was responding to law enforcement questions of “whether the laws Congress has enacted over the years to adapt [the framework of the Fourth Amendment] to changing technology, such as the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, or CALEA, are adequate to the task [of preserving the rule of law, ensuring the maintenance of public safety, and protecting individual privacy and civil liberties].</description></item><item><title>The Way Forward: Working Together to Tackle Cybercrime</title><link>/entries/the-way-forward-working-together-to-tackle-cybercr-9b44953b/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/the-way-forward-working-together-to-tackle-cybercr-9b44953b/</guid><description>Authors: Wray, Christopher

Abstract: These remarks, given by Cristopher Wray, former director of the FBI at the 2019 FBI International Conference on Cyber Security, offer an insight into the goals and capabilities of the FBI. Director Wray describes the capabilities of the FBI to combat cybersecurity, the dangers of foreign influence, and the foreign development of cyber technology. Then, Director Wray argues how encryption impedes law enforcement, describes specific crimes where encrypted information hindered an FBI investigation, and argues that lawful access to encrypted materials is increasingly necessary to law enforcement investigations.</description></item></channel></rss>
