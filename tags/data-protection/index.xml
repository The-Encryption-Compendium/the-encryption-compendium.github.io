Abstract: On November 5, 2019, Representatives Eshoo and Lofgren introduced H.R. 4978, the Online Privacy Act of 2019. H.R. 4978 sought to incorporate elements of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) into federal law. As such, the bill aimed to â€œprovide for individual rights relating to privacy of personal information, to establish privacy and security requirements for covered entities relating to personal information, and to establish an agency to be known as the United States Digital Privacy Agency to enforce such rights and requirements, and for other purposes.</description></item></channel></rss>
