Abstract: Alan Z. Rozehnstein, Associate Professor of Law at the University of Minnesota Law School, warns of the dangers of forgoing end-to-end encryption, an anticipated consequence of the powers granted to the attorney general, in the circulating draft of the EARN IT Act. Rozenhnstein argues, “the question of whether to permit ubiquitous encryption is the sort of high-level policy decision that is best handled not by the executive branch but by Congress,” recommends against the legislature “shirk[ing] its responsibility to make this tough decision,” and, in the context of the Act, calls for the exclusion of anything encryption-related from the list of best practices.</description></item><item><title>Former GCHQ Boss Backs End-to-End Encryption</title><link>/entries/former-gchq-boss-backs-end-to-end-encryption-fb367359/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/former-gchq-boss-backs-end-to-end-encryption-fb367359/</guid><description>Authors: Leyden, John
