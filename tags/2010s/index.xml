Abstract: At Motherboard, Joseph Cox reports that defense attorneys representing dozens of defendants nabbed in an FBI child pornography sting have pooled their resources in a “national working group.” A Network Investigative Technique (NIT) conducted on the child pornography website Playpen resulted in the arrest of well over 100 perpetrators, many of whom are now arguing their cases in court.</description></item><item><title>A Roadmap for Exceptional Access Research</title><link>/entries/121/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/121/</guid><description>Authors: Mayank Varia

Abstract: The U.S. government is proposing to expand wiretap design laws broadly to Internet services, including voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) services and other peerto-peer tools that allow communications in real-time directly between individuals. This report explains how mandating wiretap capabilities in endpoints poses serious security risks. Requiring software vendors to build intercept functionality into their products is unwise and will be ineffective, with the result being serious consequences for the economic well-being and national security of the United States.</description></item><item><title>Canada's Quiet Weakening of Communications Encryption</title><link>/entries/95/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/95/</guid><description>Authors: Christopher Parsons, Tamir Israel

Abstract: The recent decision by Apple and Google to enable encryption by default on new iPhones and Android smartphones, so that only the user can unlock his or her phone, has led to strong complaints from law enforcement agencies arguing that the move will deprive them of critical evidence. The Attorney General and the FBI Director have gone so far as to suggest that Congress may need to step in and tell companies to redesign their products, to ensure that government investigators can access encrypted data or wiretap online communications when they have appropriate legal authority like a search warrant.</description></item><item><title>Deep Dive into Crypto “Exceptional Access” Mandates: Effective or Constitutional—Pick One</title><link>/entries/113/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/113/</guid><description>Authors: and

Published: 2017
Abstract: Almost twenty years ago, a hostile debate over whether government could regulate encryption—later named the Crypto Wars—seized the country. At the center of this debate stirred one simple question: is encryption protected speech? This issue touched all branches of government percolating from Congress, to the President, and eventually to the federal courts. In a waterfall of cases, several United States Court of Appeals appeared to reach a consensus that encryption was protected speech under the First Amendment, and with that the Crypto Wars appeared to be over, until now.</description></item><item><title>Encryption is a human rights issue: Your privacy and free speech depend on it</title><link>/entries/182/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/182/</guid><description>Authors: Amul Kalia

Abstract: We urge you to reject any proposal that U.S. companies deliberately weaken the security of their products. We request that the White House instead focus on developing policies that will promote rather than undermine the wide adoption of strong encryption technology. Such policies will in turn help to promote and protect cybersecurity, economic growth, and human rights, both here and abroad.</description></item><item><title>Encryption, Biometrics, and the Status Quo Ante</title><link>/entries/55/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/55/</guid><description>Authors: Rosenzweig, Paul

Abstract: The Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) of 1994 Congress passed the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) in 1994, which forced telephone companies to redesign their network architectures to make it easier for law enforcement to wiretap digital telephone calls. In 2005, CALEA was expanded by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to include Internet service providers (ISPs) and VoIP services like Skype. A few years later, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) began pushing legislation trying to expand CALEA to all online communications software.</description></item><item><title>FBI Blasts Apple, Google for Locking Police out of Phones</title><link>/entries/52/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/52/</guid><description>Authors: Craig Timberg, Greg Miller

Key escrow cryptosystems used standard symmetric- and public- key ciphers, key management techniques and protocols, but with one added feature: a copy of the current session key, itself encrypted with a key known to the government, was sent at the beginning of every encrypted communication stream.</description></item><item><title>Limn: Hacking/​Journalism</title><link>/entries/38/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/38/</guid><description>Authors: Salvo, Philip Di

Abstract: Encryption and its effects on law enforcement’s access to data seem to occupy a perennial place in the headlines (and on Lawfare as well). The two of us have been working on it for years. The subject is often highly contested, but the fierce discussion has ignored some critical factors. One of those is how changing usage patterns and technologies will affect how law enforcement can—or can’t—obtain access.</description></item><item><title>Newest Androids will join iPhones in offering default encryption, blocking police</title><link>/entries/35/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/35/</guid><description>Authors: Craig Timberg
