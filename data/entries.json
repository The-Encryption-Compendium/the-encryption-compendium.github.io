It is time to start weighing the overall costs and benefits more broadly. While intelligence officials have vigorously defended the merits of the NSA programs, they have offered little hard evidence to prove their value\u2014and some of the initial analysis actually suggests that the benefits of these programs are dubious. Three different studies\u2014from the President\u2019s Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies, the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, and the New America Foundation\u2019s International Security Program\u2014question the value of bulk collection programs in stopping terrorist plots and enhancing national security. Meanwhile, there has been little sustained discussion of the costs of the NSA programs beyond their impact on privacy and liberty, and in particular, how they affect the U.S. economy, American foreign policy, and the security of the Internet as a whole.\n\nThis paper attempts to quantify and categorize the costs of the NSA surveillance programs since the initial leaks were reported in June 2013.
