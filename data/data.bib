She concludes that content-dependent techniques are not a “silver bullet against abuse” and that any marginal inhibiting effect of using end-to-end encryption will vary by abuse type. Instead, she encourages greater consideration of what she calls “content-oblivious” techniques in the ongoing policy debate regarding providers’ anti-abuse obligations and their use of end-to-end encryption.},

The Post argues that the Act would require online service providers to actively scan for Child Sexual Abuse Materials, rather than merely reporting it when it is found. By requiring providers to conduct these searches, the providers would become state actors and the searches would require a warrant, and without a warrant, these searches would be unconstitutional under the fourth amendment, and the evidence would be excluded in court proceedings. The post discusses previous child abuse sexual material reporting laws details court cases that have discusses state actor status, and ultimately argues that the law would violate the Fourth Amendment.},

The first policy track entails the “roles and responsibilities in an encrypted world”. This was defined as “the rumored, public, or potential methods and tools that are available to government surveillance agencies; where and how they are explicitly authorized; their costs and benefits; and high-level safeguards that need to be in place if they are carried out.” The group was able to identify “24 techniques or alternatives [for government] to obtain encrypted data”, and “14 factors by which to consider alternate techniques to obtain encrypted data.” The group identified future work as “comparing all 14 factors to all 24 techniques, and ranking these techniques” and holding a “[f]urther discussion to examine appropriate disclosure and transparency standards.”},

The information in each of the “Descriptive Pills” is based on research gathered by CEPI between 2017 and 2018.

The blog post points out that despite the increased prevalence of encryption, few wiretap searches by law enforcement even encountered encryption, and never did it interfere with the investigation. The proposes that with the increased prevalence of encryption, law enforcement methods have adapted. Furthermore, Blaze gives examples and argues that encryption works at a wholesale level, but does not prevent targeted investigation.},

The computer scientist, John Gilmore, “decided to transmit the paper to make a point about what he considers the suppression of valuable information on the technology of writing and deciphering messages in code, or cryptography.” The NSA’s main concerns were that “advances in cryptography will make it harder to break coded transmissions sent by foreign intelligence agents in the United States to their government [and] it will have more trouble protecting its own codes.” Despite the NSA’s insistence that the paper not be published, Gilmore faced no criminal or civil penalties.},

Prior to the symposium, the group received a letter from an NSA employee who told the group that “merely publishing a scientific paper on cryptography would be the legal equivalent of exporting nuclear weapons to a foreign country.” A lawyer at Stanford advised the group they could legally publish the information. The group decided to do so, and the fact that “a group of nongovernmental researchers could publicly discuss cutting-edge cryptographic algorithms signaled the end of the U.S. government’s domestic control of information on cryptography.” While the researchers believed that” inadequate commercial cryptography...poses an internal national security threat”, the NSA was worried that “foreign countries” would take this information and make it harder for American intelligence services to decrypt and read data. As such, the NSA tried to have Congress pass legislation to limit the publication of cryptography research, but that did not work due to the policy aims of Congress and the Carter Administration. Instead, the NSA created “a voluntary system of prepublication review for cryptography research papers,” and relied on research funding and national standards to guide the publications.},

At the same time, the increasing use of encryption that cannot be decrypted when we have the lawful authority to collect information risks allowing criminals, terrorists, hackers and other threats to escape detection.” He closed out his remarks with a plea for help: “I believe that if our businesses and academics put their mind to it, they will find a solution that does not compromise the integrity of encryption technology but that enables both encryption to protect privacy and decryption under lawful authority to protect national security.},

The Department of Justice described tool as essential in the “prevention, investigation and prosecution of serious offences and the investigation of threats to the security of Canada.” The Consultation Document featured a series of legislative proposals, focused on modernizing the infrastructure capabilities and amending the criminal code (and other authorizing statutes), to ensure Lawful Access remained consistent with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and adapted to rapid technological changes.},

The paper begins with a carrot and stick analogy on early 1990s encryption regulations. The stick, classification of encryption as a munition and its deterrent effect on incorporation of strong encryption in consumer products. The carrot, an exception for systems incorporating a backdoor (the key escrow system). The paper also provides a technical overview of the Clipper Chip before delving into Blaze’s personal experiences with AT\&T’s device, the TSD-3600 Telephone Security Device, while employed by the company. Blaze details the flaws he uncovered in the system, his published research on the matter, and how his discoveries landed him at the center of the system-killing New York Times piece, Flaw Found in Federal Plan for Wiretapping.},

Senator Grassley also lent credence to concerns of officials within the privacy and technology communities that any reform would undermine the privacy interests of US citizens and the international competitiveness of domestic technology companies.

In 2013 the FBI again pushed “for a wholesale expansion of CALEA to all Internet communications services”. While this did not succeed, the article noted the FBI will resurface its argument on a yearly basis.

While he noted that concerns about terrorism are valid, he said it is “very important that we should be seen and be a country in which people can operate securely – that’s important for our commercial interests as well as our security interests, so encryption in that context is very positive”.},

	abstract = {In 1998, an article was published in the International Review of Law, Computers \& Technology, which advocated for the implementation of a federal encryption scheme which utilizes export controls and a key recovery system. Export controls should be used to address issues with gathering foreign intelligence for national security matters, and a key recovery system should be used to meet the needs of law enforcement when they conduct investigations. The author argues that this regulatory scheme will “effectively balance individual privacy rights and governmental interests”. When discussing export controls and the key recovery system, the article proposes changes to legislation, analyzes the constitutionality of the proposed scheme, and discusses the policy arguments against both. The article concludes that Congress and President Clinton must act swiftly in order to protect America’s future, and argues that “the basic outline of an encryption policy which would protect our national security” already exists through exports controls and a key recovery system.},

Since the paradigm shift, “data is undecryptable”, due to Fifth Amendment constraints “access through lawful process if often not possible”, and the subject of an investigation “does not get notice”. The author proposed that implementing mandatory biometric encryption is the key to dealing with the paradigm shift. The author described mandatory biometric encryption as allowing “strong encryption for data at rest, just as encryption advocates want, but require manufacturers to activate the encryption using a biometric key (such as a fingerprint or iris) rather than a pass phrase”. The author discussed the advantages of using mandatory biometric encryption and states that the proposal will “return us to the status quo ante”.},

Kolkman noted that, due to the public availability of the mathematical theory on which encryption is built, “even if vendors are forced to build backdoors, the bad guys will still be able to use unbreakable encryption.” Kolkman also argued that backdoors could have the unintended consequence of increasing exposure to bad actors, as the backdoors would become a more readily identifiable vulnerability within a given system.

In 1998, the BXA was tasked with implementing the Clinton Administration’s commercial encryption policy. BXA was tasked with the objective of “promot[ing] growth of electronic commerce and secure communications worldwide while protecting the public safety and national security.” Highlights from the 1998 Report include the finalization of guidelines and implementation of regulations permitting the export of licensed encryption products to banks and financial institutions in 45 countries. The regulation established licensing policies and procedures for companies to obtain approval to export encryption products; created license exceptions for export of very strong encryption of any key length to certain industry sectors; and allowed encryption hardware and software with encryption strength up to 56-bit DES (or its equivalent) to be exported without a license. The Report estimated the regulation impacted encryption exports for the world’s 100 largest banks and roughly 70 percent of the world’s financial institutions.},

The letter states that the petition fulfilled the threshold requirements for an official response from the Administration, and that the Administration, which the website pledges will provide an official response within 60 days of meeting the threshold, has not provided a substantive response in the 365 days since that date. The letter then describes various actions taken by the FBI, U.S. Congress, state legislatures, China, the UK, Brazil, Russia, and India that “undermine the security of the global internet” and “endanger the technology sector globally”. The letter’s purpose is to urge President Obama to “repudiate any type of mandate requiring third-party access to encrypted data, both stored and in transit,” and to “clarify the United States’ position and establish its leadership on this critically important topic.”},

These factors include the erosion of trust, removal of companies and products from the Australian market, inadequate accountability and limitations on law enforcement, the threat that foreign governments who invoke the bill, without transparency, for a “serious crime” with abuse this right, the increased threat of malicious activity from bad actors, omission of key considerations, and the fact that the bill is more likely to hinder than help Australians and their government. This purpose of this piece is to advocate that Australian Parliamentarians postpone enacting the bill until they can demonstrate it is necessary, and notes that they can still “act to substantially revise its provisions or even vacate the law altogether in favor of a more thoughtful, useful, and effective approach that would preserve digital security and protect human rights.”},

At-issue was whether the licensing requirements for the export of cryptographic devices and software in ITAR, and the export control over related technical data, constitute an impermissible infringement on speech in violation of the First Amendment. The court reasoned that because the ITAR licensing scheme fails to provide for a time limit on the licensing decision, prompt judicial review, and a duty on the part of the ODTC to go to court and defend a denial of a license, it is an unconstitutional prior restraint in violation of the First Amendment.},

The new policy prevented anyone but the device’s owner from gaining access to the vast trove of user data stored on Apple devices; however, the protection does not reach user data stored elsewhere, such as in the iCloud. The move was praised by civil liberties advocates, as an important step towards prioritizing consumer privacy, and condemned by law enforcement officials, who viewed it as an impediment to preventing and solving crimes. Apple has continued to steadfastly enforce this policy. Most notably, in January 2020, Apple refused to unlock the iPhones of the suspected shooter at Pensacola Naval Air Station.

	abstract = {Alan Z. Rozenshtein, Associate Professor of Law at the University of Minnesota Law School, warns of the dangers of forgoing end-to-end encryption, an anticipated consequence of the powers granted to the attorney general, in the circulating draft of the EARN IT Act. Rozenshtein argues, “the question of whether to permit ubiquitous encryption is the sort of high-level policy decision that is best handled not by the executive branch but by Congress,” recommends against the legislature “shirk[ing] its responsibility to make this tough decision,” and, in the context of the Act, calls for the exclusion of anything encryption-related from the list of best practices. 

The EARN IT Act was first introduced, by Senator Lindsay Graham, to Congress on March 5, 2020, considered by the Senate Judiciary Committee on June 25, 2020, cleared committee and was placed on the Legislative Calendar on July 20, 2020. The Act has been a source of considerable concern for its encryption-related consequences.},

	url = {https://www.newamerica.org/oti/policy-papers/surveillance-costs-the-nsas-impact-on-the-economy-internet-freedom-cybersecurity/},
	abstract = {It has been over a year since The Guardian reported the first story on the National Security Agency’s surveillance programs based on the leaks from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, yet the national conversation remains largely mired in a simplistic debate over the tradeoffs between national security and individual privacy. It is time to start weighing the overall costs and benefits more broadly. While intelligence officials have vigorously defended the merits of the NSA programs, they have offered little hard evidence to prove their value—and some of the initial analysis actually suggests that the benefits of these programs are dubious. Three different studies—from the President’s Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies, the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, and the New America Foundation’s International Security Program—question the value of bulk collection programs in stopping terrorist plots and enhancing national security. Meanwhile, there has been little sustained discussion of the costs of the NSA programs beyond their impact on privacy and liberty, and in particular, how they affect the U.S. economy, American foreign policy, and the security of the Internet as a whole.

This paper attempts to quantify and categorize the costs of the NSA surveillance programs since the initial leaks were reported in June 2013. Our findings indicate that the NSA’s actions have already begun to, and will continue to, cause significant damage to the interests of the United States and the global Internet community.},

	abstract = {In recent years, there has been a substantial amount of research on quantum computers –machines that exploit quantum mechanical phenomena to solve mathematical problems that are difficult or intractable for conventional computers. If large-scale quantum computers are ever built, they will be able to break many of the public-key cryptosystems currently in use. This would seriously compromise the confidentiality and integrity of digital communications on the Internet and elsewhere. The goal of post-quantum cryptography (also called quantum-resistant cryptography) is to develop cryptographic systems that are secure against both quantum and classical computers, and can interoperate with existing communications protocols and networks. This Internal Report shares the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)’s current understanding about the status of quantum computing and post-quantum cryptography, and outlines NIST’s initial plan to move forward in this space. The report also recognizes the challenge of moving to new cryptographic infrastructures and therefore emphasizes the need for agencies to focus on crypto agility.},

Reg. 62600 (2000). It describes how the decision by the European Union (EU) Council of Ministers on 22 June 2000, to create a license free zone for exports of encryption (and other) items (referred to herein as the “EU Regulations”) provided the initial stimulus for these changes. It also describes how the US Regulations fall short of matching the EU Regulations in some respects, while exceeding the EU Regulations in other respects. In addition, the authors offer recommendations for further reforms to the US encryption export control policy that might be addressed by the next administration in Washington. They conclude on a cautionary note, considering the possibility that the recent reforms to US encryption export control policy could be reversed in the future.},
