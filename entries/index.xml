L. Rivest, A. Shamir, L. Adleman
Published: April 1977
URL: https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/Rsapaper.pdf
Abstract: An encryption method is presented with the novel property that publicly revealing an encryption key does not thereby reveal the corresponding decryption key. This has two important consequences:
Couriers or other secure means are not needed to transmit keys, since a message can be enciphered using an encryption key publicly revealed by the intended recipient.</description></item><item><title/><link>/entries/1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/1/</guid><description>Academic: The Risks of Key Recovery, Key Escrow, and Trusted Third-Party Encryption - Schneier on Security Authors: H.

Abstract: A variety of &amp;ldquo;key recovery,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;key escrow,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;trusted third-party&amp;rdquo; encryption requirements have been suggested in recent years by government agencies seeking to conduct covert surveillance within the changing environments brought about by new technologies.</description></item><item><title/><link>/entries/10/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/10/</guid><description>Bureau of Export Administration Annual Report 1998 Authors: Bureau of Export Administration

URL: http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2076732.2076777
Abstract: In 1993, the US Government proposed a novel (and highly controversial) approach to cryptography, called key escrow. Key escrow cryptosystems used standard symmetric- and public- key ciphers, key management techniques and protocols, but with one added feature: a copy of the current session key, itself encrypted with a key known to the government, was sent at the beginning of every encrypted communication stream.</description></item><item><title/><link>/entries/101/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/101/</guid><description>New directions in cryptography Authors: W.

Abstract: The US Government has been busy on the encryption front in both positive and negative ways. On the positive front, there is a major effort underway to move all government websites to HTTPS; I’ll discuss that in a future post.

Abstract: Recently, U.S. law enforcement officials have re-energized their push for a technical means to bypass encryption. But seeking to undermine encryption only looks backward instead of focusing on where technology is going. We should be having conversations about new investigative techniques, not trying to preserve the access enjoyed in the days before encryption was so widespread, particularly when so much is at stake in doing so.</description></item><item><title/><link>/entries/144/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/144/</guid><description>U.S. Says It Has Unlocked iPhone Without Apple Published: March 2016

Abstract: Encryption and its effects on law enforcement’s access to data seem to occupy a perennial place in the headlines (and on Lawfare as well). The two of us have been working on it for years. The subject is often highly contested, but the fierce discussion has ignored some critical factors. One of those is how changing usage patterns and technologies will affect how law enforcement can—or can’t—obtain access.</description></item><item><title/><link>/entries/151/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/151/</guid><description>The PEOPLE of the State of Colorado, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.

Abstract: Twenty years ago, law enforcement organizations lobbied to require data and communication services to engineer their products to guarantee law enforcement access to all data. After lengthy debate and vigorous predictions of enforcement channels “going dark,” these attempts to regulate the emerging Internet were abandoned. In the intervening years, innovation on the Internet ﬂourished, and law enforcement agencies found new and more eﬀective means of accessing vastly larger quantities of data.</description></item><item><title/><link>/entries/159/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/159/</guid><description>The Metaphor is the Key: Cryptography, The Clipper Chip, and the Constitution © 1995 A.Michael Froomkin Published: 1996

Abstract: As the 21st century approaches, encryption is presenting a national security dilemma in the US. While the use of strong encryption for computerized data is essential in protecting our nation, widespread, unregulated encryption poses serious problems on two levels: encryption could inhibit the government&amp;rsquo;s ability to enforce the law as well as gather foreign intelligence. As a result, the government has established export controls on encryption products and proposed a &amp;lsquo;key recovery&amp;rsquo; system designed to enable law enforcement officers to access encrypted data in the course of lawful investigations.</description></item><item><title/><link>/entries/180/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/180/</guid><description>Limn: Hacking/​Journalism Published: April 2017

Abstract: Encryption is essential to Australia’s modern digital society, economy, and cyber security, and it is only effective if it is strong and robust.
Strong encryption serves Australia’s national interests by protecting governments, communities, and the economy from criminal, terrorist, and state-sponsored attacks.
Encryption will only become more important for protecting Australian interests as technology advances in the coming decades.</description></item><item><title/><link>/entries/185/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/185/</guid><description>Report of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression on his mission to Liberia Published: June 2018</description></item><item><title/><link>/entries/186/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/186/</guid><description>OPEN LETTER: FACEBOOK’S END-TO-END SECURITY PLANS Published: October 2019

Abstract: The recent decision by Apple and Google to enable encryption by default on new iPhones and Android smartphones, so that only the user can unlock his or her phone, has led to strong complaints from law enforcement agencies arguing that the move will deprive them of critical evidence. The Attorney General and the FBI Director have gone so far as to suggest that Congress may need to step in and tell companies to redesign their products, to ensure that government investigators can access encrypted data or wiretap online communications when they have appropriate legal authority like a search warrant.</description></item><item><title/><link>/entries/20/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/20/</guid><description>Announcing the ADVANCED ENCRYPTION STANDARD (AES) Authors: NIST

URL: https://cdt.org/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/CALEAII-techreport.pdf
Abstract: The U.S. government is proposing to expand wiretap design laws broadly to Internet services, including voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) services and other peerto-peer tools that allow communications in real-time directly between individuals. This report explains how mandating wiretap capabilities in endpoints poses serious security risks. Requiring software vendors to build intercept functionality into their products is unwise and will be ineffective, with the result being serious consequences for the economic well-being and national security of the United States.</description></item><item><title/><link>/entries/34/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/34/</guid><description>American Cryptography during the Cold War, 1945-1989 Authors: National Security Agency

Abstract: An editorial contends that the new White House proposal to keep high-powered encryption software out of the hands of foreign terrorists and criminals is needlessly restrictive and probably unworkable. The editorial says that the technology, which is legal in the US, is a good way for honest citizens to prevent crime and should be disseminated domestically and abroad.</description></item><item><title/><link>/entries/37/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/37/</guid><description>GAO Report on Communications Privacy Authors: U.S. General Accounting Office

Abstract: At a meeting earlier this year by concerned industry players, the government was told that proposed restrictions were impractical because criminals had access to offshore encryption products. Further, the wait for a concrete policy was hurting business because companies were unsure of what they&amp;rsquo;d be allowed to sell. Shipping delays were costing money, officials from companies like kyberpass Corp.</description></item><item><title/><link>/entries/47/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/47/</guid><description>Crypto Summit 1.0 - Access Now Authors: Accessnow

Abstract: The Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) of 1994 Congress passed the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) in 1994, which forced telephone companies to redesign their network architectures to make it easier for law enforcement to wiretap digital telephone calls.

Abstract: Almost twenty years ago, a hostile debate over whether government could regulate encryption—later named the Crypto Wars—seized the country. At the center of this debate stirred one simple question: is encryption protected speech? This issue touched all branches of government percolating from Congress, to the President, and eventually to the federal courts. In a waterfall of cases, several United States Court of Appeals appeared to reach a consensus that encryption was protected speech under the First Amendment, and with that the Crypto Wars appeared to be over, until now.</description></item><item><title/><link>/entries/54/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/54/</guid><description>Complete ACM Columns Collection Authors: John Perry Barlow

Abstract: Attacks of Sept 11 renew debate on how strongly public&amp;ndash;and by extension terrorists and other criminals&amp;ndash;should be able to encrypt their electronic messages; technology of scrambling data and messages has become crucial element of computer security for businesses and consumers; officials of law enforcement and intelligence agencies have long warned lawmakers that they were unable to break strongest encryption products, and that crimes eventually would be committed that might otherwise have been prevented; FBI has not said publicly whether hijackers who attacked World Trade Center and Pentagon even used encryption to cloak their communications; Philip R Zimmermann, creator of popular encryption programs, known as PGP, says he would be surprised if this were not case; Sen Judd Gregg says he will not make specific legislative proposal until he sees what Atty Gen John Ashcroft includes in final version of his broad anti-terrorism bill; says he wants to see legislation to order encryption companies that sell products in US to include back door that would allow government access when terrorist uses encyption (M)</description></item><item><title/><link>/entries/56/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/56/</guid><description>Congress Mulls Stiff Crypto Laws Published: September 2001

Abstract: A variety of &amp;ldquo;key recovery,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;key escrow,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;trusted third-party&amp;rdquo; encryption requirements have been suggested in recent years by government agencies seeking to conduct covert surveillance within the changing environments brought about by new technologies.

Abstract: As the recent indirect debate between FBI Director James Comey and co-blogger Susan Landau makes clear, the underlying premises of the encryption issue are highly contested. The Senate will continue the debate this week with a hearing before the Judiciary Committee on July 8 at which our own Herb Lin (among others) will testify and another hearing before the Intelligence Committee.</description></item><item><title/><link>/entries/77/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/77/</guid><description>Anonymity and Encryption Published: February 2015

Abstract: The problems of online security and the non-economic benefits of encryption are well understood, but there has yet to be a comprehensive analysis of the economic benefits created by the spread of encryption. This is not surprising. When encryption is working properly, the user is not even aware of its existence.</description></item><item><title/><link>/entries/85/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/85/</guid><description>Canada&amp;rsquo;s Quiet Weakening of Communications Encryption Published: August 2015

Abstract: U.S. government agencies have identified the inability to access information on encrypted mobile phones as one of the largest current challenges to criminal investigations. In September 2017, Access Now, supported by the Mozilla Foundation’s Tech Policy Fellowship, hosted the Crypto Colloquium — an invite-only dialogue, with participation under the Chatham House rules — to discuss this challenge. Participants represented four stakeholder groups: civil society, academic experts, technology companies, and former U.</description></item><item><title/><link>/entries/89/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/89/</guid><description>Encryption Letter to Obama May 19, 2015 Published: May 2015

Abstract: We urge you to reject any proposal that U.S. companies deliberately weaken the security of their products. We request that the White House instead focus on developing policies that will promote rather than undermine the wide adoption of strong encryption technology. Such policies will in turn help to promote and protect cybersecurity, economic growth, and human rights, both here and abroad.</description></item><item><title/><link>/entries/9/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/entries/9/</guid><description>Congress, Not the Attorney General, Should Decide the Future of Encryption Authors: Alan Z.
