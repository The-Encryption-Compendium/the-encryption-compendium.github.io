At the center of this debate stirred one simple question: is encryption protected speech? This issue touched all branches of government percolating from Congress, to the President, and eventually to the federal courts. In a waterfall of cases, several United States Court of Appeals appeared to reach a consensus that encryption was protected speech under the First Amendment, and with that the Crypto Wars appeared to be over, until now.\nNearly twenty years later, the Crypto Wars have returned. Following recent mass shootings, law enforcement has once again questioned the legal protection for encryption and tried to implement \u201cbackdoor\u201d techniques to access messages sent over encrypted channels. In the case, Apple v. FBI, the agency tried to compel Apple to grant access to the iPhone of a San Bernardino shooter. The case was never decided, but the legal arguments briefed before the court were essentially the same as they were two decades prior. Apple and amici supporting the company argued that encryption was protected speech.\nWhile these arguments remain convincing, circumstances have changed in ways that should be reflected in the legal doctrines that lawyers use. Unlike twenty years ago, today surveillance is ubiquitous, and the need for encryption is no longer felt by a seldom few. Encryption has become necessary for even the most basic exchange of information given that most Americans share \u201cnearly every aspect of\ntheir lives\u2014from the mundane to the intimate\u201d over the Internet, as stated in a recent Supreme Court opinion.1\nGiven these developments, lawyers might consider a new justification under the Press Clause. In addition to the many doctrinal concerns that exist with protection under the Speech Clause, the Press Clause is normatively and descriptively more accurate at protecting encryption as a tool for secure communication without fear of government surveillance. This Article outlines that framework by examining the historical and theoretical transformation of the Press Clause since its inception.","publisher_text":null,"year":2017,"month":null,"day":null,"url":null,"authors":[],"tags":["2010s","Press Clause"]},{"id":7,"title":"Doomed to Repeat History?","abstract":null,"publisher_text":null,"year":2015,"month":6,"day":null,"url":null,"authors":[],"tags":["1990s","Crypto Wars","OTI"]},{"id":8,"title":"Announcing the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)","abstract":null,"publisher_text":null,"year":2001,"month":11,"day":null,"url":"https://web.archive.org/web/20030406010431/http://www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips197/fips-197.pdf","authors":["NIST"],"tags":["2000s","AES","NIST","Standards"]},{"id":9,"title":"Amicus Brief in Support of Apple Inc's Motion to Vacate","abstract":"In the Matter of the Search of an Apple Iphone Seized During the Execution of a Search Warrant on a BLack Lexus IS300, California License Plate 35KGD203","publisher_text":null,"year":2016,"month":3,"day":null,"url":null,"authors":["Access Now","Wickr Foundation"],"tags":[]},{"id":10,"title":"IC on the Record, Video: ODNI General Counsel Robert Litt","abstract":"VIDEO:\u00a0 ODNI General Counsel Robert Litt Speaks on Intelligence Surveillance Reform at the Brookings Institute","publisher_text":"IC ON THE RECORD","year":2015,"month":2,"day":null,"url":"https://icontherecord.tumblr.com/post/110099240063/video-odni-general-counsel-robert-litt-speaks-on","authors":["Robert Litt"],"tags":["2010s","National Security","Personal Privacy","Surveillance"]},{"id":11,"title":"How secure is AES against brute force attacks?","abstract":"This article describes the strength of the cryptographic system against brute force attacks with different key sizes and the time it takes to successfully mount a brute force attack factoring future advancements in processing speeds.","publisher_text":"EETimes","year":2012,"month":5,"day":null,"url":"https://www.eetimes.com/how-secure-is-aes-against-brute-force-attacks/","authors":[],"tags":["2010s","AES","Keys"]},{"id":12,"title":"The People of the State of Colorado, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.

It is time to start weighing the overall costs and benefits more broadly. While intelligence officials have vigorously defended the merits of the NSA programs, they have offered little hard evidence to prove their value\u2014and some of the initial analysis actually suggests that the benefits of these programs are dubious. Three different studies\u2014from the President\u2019s Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies, the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, and the New America Foundation\u2019s International Security Program\u2014question the value of bulk collection programs in stopping terrorist plots and enhancing national security. Meanwhile, there has been little sustained discussion of the costs of the NSA programs beyond their impact on privacy and liberty, and in particular, how they affect the U.S. economy, American foreign policy, and the security of the Internet as a whole.\n\nThis paper attempts to quantify and categorize the costs of the NSA surveillance programs since the initial leaks were reported in June 2013.

However, technologists and privacy advocates say that such a move would undermine the overall security of our data and devices while also putting US companies at a serious disadvantage in the global technology marketplace, and point to the fact that law enforcement and intelligence agencies already have access to more data about us, our communications, and our movements than at any other time in human history\u2014a veritable \u201cGolden Age\u201d of surveillance.

While the use of strong encryption for computerized data is essential in protecting our nation, widespread, unregulated encryption poses serious problems on two levels: encryption could inhibit the government's ability to enforce the law as well as gather foreign intelligence. As a result, the government has established export controls on encryption products and proposed a 'key recovery' system designed to enable law enforcement officers to access encrypted data in the course of lawful investigations. The export controls have been ineffective and counterproductive policy and are arguably unconstitutional under the First Amendment. However, export controls are the only viable solution to the intelligence gathering problem and will need to survive these political and legal attacks or our national security could be jeopardized. Key recovery will be difficult and costly to implement and has come under attack by civil liberties' groups. Nevertheless, a cost-effective compromise on key recovery is necessary to meet the needs of law enforcement. Such a system, if it mirrored current electronic surveillance law, would effectively balance individual privacy rights and governmental interests and thus should survive constitutional scrutiny. Congress and President Clinton ought to enact key recovery legislation soon before the use of encryption becomes commonplace. A failure to act intelligently and effectively on this critical, cutting-edge issue could compromise our nation's future.","publisher_text":"International Review of Law, Computers \\& Technology","year":1998,"month":7,"day":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/13600869855487","authors":[],"tags":["1990s","Clinton","Export Controls","Law Enforcement"]},{"id":31,"title":"U.S. Relaxes Export Controls on Supercomputers \\textbar Arms Control Association","abstract":null,"publisher_text":null,"year":null,"month":null,"day":null,"url":"https://www.armscontrol.org/act/1999-07/press-releases/us-relaxes-export-controls-supercomputers","authors":[],"tags":["1990s","Clinton","Export Controls"]},{"id":32,"title":"Deep Dive into Crypto \u201cExceptional Access\u201d Mandates: Effective or Constitutional\u2014Pick One","abstract":"Readers of these pages will be familiar with the debate going on between government officials and technologists around the world about law enforcement\u2019s perceived need to access the content of any and all encrypted communications.[fn]This debate often combines and indeed confuses encryption of...","publisher_text":"Electronic Frontier Foundation","year":2015,"month":8,"day":null,"url":"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/08/deep-dive-crypto-exceptional-access-mandates-effective-or-constitutional-pick-one","authors":["and"],"tags":["2010s","CALEA","Mandates","Prior Restraint"]},{"id":33,"title":"Crypto Summit 2.0 Outcomes","abstract":null,"publisher_text":null,"year":2016,"month":3,"day":null,"url":"https://www.accessnow.org/cms/assets/uploads/2016/07/CS2.0_Outcomes_Track1.pdf","authors":["Accessnow"],"tags":[]},{"id":34,"title":"Considerations for Encryption in Public Safety Radio Systems","abstract":null,"publisher_text":null,"year":2016,"month":9,"day":null,"url":null,"authors":[],"tags":[]},{"id":35,"title":"Congress Mulls Stiff Crypto Laws","abstract":"Some lawmakers say encryption laws can let terrorists plot attacks such as Tuesday's assaults on the East Coast.

Key escrow cryptosystems used standard symmetric- and public- key ciphers, key management techniques and protocols, but with one added feature: a copy of the current session key, itself encrypted with a key known to the government, was sent at the beginning of every encrypted communication stream. In this way, if a government wiretapper encountered ciphertext produced under a key escrowed cryptosystem, recovering the plaintext would be a simple matter of decrypting the session key with the government\u2019s key, regardless of the strength of the underlying cipher algorithms. Key escrow was intended to strike a \u201cbalance\u201d between the needs for e\ufb00ective communications security against bad guys on the one hand and the occasional need for the good guys to be able to recover meaningful content from (presumably) legally-authorized wiretaps.","publisher_text":"ACM Press","year":2011,"month":null,"day":null,"url":"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2076732.2076777","authors":[],"tags":["1990s","2010s","Crypto Wars","Crypto Wars I"]},{"id":74,"title":"New directions in cryptography","abstract":null,"publisher_text":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","year":1976,"month":11,"day":null,"url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1055638/","authors":["W.

In 2005, CALEA was expanded by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to include Internet service providers (ISPs) and VoIP services like Skype. A few years later, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) began pushing legislation trying to expand CALEA to all online communications software. After an uproar, the proposal died quietly, but resurfaced in 2010, and again in 2013. In May of that year, the New York Times reported the White House as \"on the verge\" of backing the rumored FBI proposal. The newest proposal would not only expand CALEA to all online communications services, but would allow the FBI to fine noncompliant companies. Now, in 2014 the issue as at the forefront again, with the FBI calling for a national \u201cdiscussion\u201d about the use of encryption. \u00a0We expect the issue to continue to be front-page news for the foreseeable future. 2004: Expansion By the Federal Communications Commission For ten years CALEA only applied to telephone companies, but in 2004 the Department of Justice (DOJ), FBI, and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) filed a joint petition with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) asking it to expand CALEA to cover communications that travel over the Internet. Specifically, the petition requested CALEA apply to broadband providers, to VoIP communications, and to other kinds of instant messaging programs. EFF objected to a number of the requests in the joint petition in conjunction with numerous other organizations. Despite the objections, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) expanding CALEA to broadband Internet access providers and managed VoIP systems. After a yearlong rulemaking process, the FCC announced a Final Rule confirming the expansions in the NPRM. Congress explicitly exempted data traveling over the Internet in CALEA, but the FCC ruled that CALEA could be expanded to Internet broadband providers, like ISPs, and certain VoIP providers. As a result, EFF and a coalition of public interest, industry, and academic groups challenged the FCC's unjustified expansion in the DC circuit court. Despite Judge Harry Edwards declaring the FCC's argument \"gobbedldygook,\" and \"utter nonsense,\" the court approved the FCC's expansion. 2010: Give the Government an Inch of CALEA and It Will Take a Mile of Your Privacy In 2010, the FBI began its \"Going Dark\" campaign. Despite the fact that we are in a Golden Age of Surveillance, the campaign is a charm offensive to convince politicians that FBI is unable to listen in on Internet users' digital communications after obtaining a court order because of recent advances in technology. The proposed legislation would have forced all communications services to build secret backdoors for the government to spy on users and to decrypt any encrypted messages exchanged via the service. The proposal's problems were many, and it quietly died after a tremendous amount of uproar. Shortly after the 2010 proposal, EFF filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit against three agencies of the Department of Justice (DOJ) demanding records that would justify the Administration\u2019s need to expand federal surveillance laws like CALEA. Within a year, EFF received only a few hundred documents out of the thousands the DOJ said it possessed. It's been three years, and the DOJ has continued to stall the release of the entire records. 2013 and Onwards In the beginning of 2013, it was reported the FBI was again pushing for a wholesale expansion of CALEA to all Internet communications services. Similar to 2010, the FBI wants to force all companies with messaging services to engineer their products with a secret government backdoor and to decrypt all encrypted messages. The proposal also adds another component: fining companies for not cooperating. In May 2013, the New York Times revealed that the White House was \"on the verge\" of backing the proposal. While the bill was not introduced in 2013, updating CALEA was a stated priority for FBI Director James Comey in 2014 and we expect it to be so for 2015 as well. CALEA Must Not Be Expanded The 2013 proposal is a tremendous blow to security and privacy. The FBI already has an unprecedented level of access to our communications and personal data; access which it regularly uses. And we\u2019ve seen government mandated backdoors\u2014so-called CALEA interfaces\u2014being used by criminals as the point-and-click wiretapping that they are. In an age where the government claims to want to beef up Internet security, any backdoors into our communications makes our infrastructure weaker.

When the Court rules, the original understanding of the Fifth Amendment may control the outcome. This Article details an extraordinary case that illuminates the original understanding of the privilege and its application to compelled decryption. During the 1807 treason trial of Aaron Burr, with Chief Justice John Marshall presiding, the government asked Burr\u2019s private secretary if he knew the cipher to an encrypted letter Burr had sent to a co-conspirator. Burr\u2019s secretary pled the Fifth, leading to an extensive debate on the meaning of the privilege and an opinion from the Chief Justice.The Burr dispute presents a remarkable opportunity to unearth the original understanding of the Fifth Amendment and its application to surprisingly modern facts. The lawyers in Burr were celebrated and experienced advocates. The Chief Justice allowed them to argue the Fifth Amendment question in exhaustive detail. And an attorney recorded the entire argument in shorthand, including dozens of legal citations to the specific pages of the authorities the lawyers invoked. The rich materials allow us to reconstruct for the first time precisely how the privilege was understood by leading lawyers and Chief Justice John Marshall soon after the Fifth Amendment\u2019s ratification. The Article presents that reconstruction, and it concludes by applying Burr\u2019s lessons to the modern problem of compelled decryption of digital devices such as cell phones and computers.","publisher_text":null,"year":2020,"month":2,"day":null,"url":"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3533069","authors":["Orin S.

Encryption is currently the only reliable means of securing the confidentiality of such communications and can help citizens and businesses defend themselves against fraud, electronic vandalism and the improper disclosure of confidential information. However, because of its unique ability to conceal data, encryption may also be deployed for illegitimate purposes. This prospect has urged law enforcement agencies and governments to call for restrictions on its use and development. Privacy advocates and business interest groups resist any attempts to limit encryption arguing that to do so would unfairly compromise the privacy of individuals and jeopardise the development of electronic commerce. This paper looks at the tension between the two sides to this heated debate and studies how law makers in the US and Europe have chosen to meet the challenge of regulating this area.","publisher_text":null,"year":2000,"month":6,"day":null,"url":"https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/law/elj/jilt/2000_2/andrews/","authors":["Sarah Andrews"],"tags":["2000s","E-Commerce","EPIC","Europe","Human Rights","USA"]},{"id":161,"title":"Report on Post-Quantum Cryptography","abstract":"In recent years, there has been a substantial amount of research on quantum computers \u2013machines that exploit quantum mechanical phenomena to solve mathematical problems that are difficult or intractable for conventional computers. If large-scale quantum computers are ever built, they will be able to break many of the public-key cryptosystems currently in use. This would seriously compromise the confidentiality and integrity of digital communications on the Internet and elsewhere. The goal of post-quantum cryptography (also called quantum-resistant cryptography) is to develop cryptographic systems that are secure against both quantum and classical computers, and can interoperate with existing communications protocols and networks. This Internal Report shares the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)\u2019s current understanding about the status of quantum computing and post-quantum cryptography, and outlines NIST\u2019s initial plan to move forward in this space. The report also recognizes the challenge of moving to new cryptographic infrastructures and therefore emphasizes the need for agencies to focus on crypto agility.","publisher_text":null,"year":2016,"month":4,"day":null,"url":"https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2016/NIST.IR.8105.pdf","authors":["Lily Chen","Stephen Jordan","Yi-Kai Liu","Dustin Moody","Rene Peralta","Ray Perlner","Daniel Smith-Tone"],"tags":["2010s","NIST","Quantum","USA"]},{"id":162,"title":"Protecting the Fourth Amendment in the Information Age: A Response to Robert Litt","abstract":null,"publisher_text":null,"year":2016,"month":null,"day":null,"url":null,"authors":[],"tags":["2010s","IV Amendment","USA"]},{"id":163,"title":"HTTPS-Everywhere for Government","abstract":"Today, the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued the HTTPS-Only Standard directive, requiring that all publicly accessible Federal websites and web services only provide service through a secure HTTPS connection.","publisher_text":"whitehouse.gov","year":2015,"month":6,"day":null,"url":"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2015/06/08/https-everywhere-government","authors":[],"tags":["2010s","HTTPS","Obama","USA"]},{"id":164,"title":"Ex-NSA Chief Michael Hayden opposes backdoors in encryption - Business Insider","abstract":null,"publisher_text":null,"year":2016,"month":2,"day":null,"url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/michael-hayden-encryption-apple-2016-2","authors":["pzdupe2"],"tags":["2010s","NSA","National Security","USA"]},{"id":165,"title":"Encryption is a human rights issue: Your privacy and free speech depend on it","abstract":"Encryption was at the heart of the ideas that led to the America\u2019s founding.\nLearn More...","publisher_text":null,"year":2016,"month":12,"day":null,"url":"https://www.learnliberty.org/blog/encryption-is-a-human-rights-issue-your-privacy-and-free-speech-depend-on-it/","authors":["Amul Kalia"],"tags":["2010s","Human Rights","UN","USA"]},{"id":166,"title":"Dutch Government Backs Uncrackable Encryption \\textbar Fortune","abstract":null,"publisher_text":null,"year":2016,"month":1,"day":null,"url":"https://fortune.com/2016/01/05/dutch-government-encryption-no-backdoors/","authors":["Robert Hackett"],"tags":["2010s","Backdoors","NED"]},{"id":167,"title":"H.R. 4170 - Ensuring National Constitutional Rights for Your Private Telecommunicatyions Act of 2019","abstract":"A Bill To preempt State data security vulnerability manfates and decryption requirements.","publisher_text":null,"year":2019,"month":8,"day":null,"url":null,"authors":[],"tags":["Bill","Decryption","ENCRYPTION","Federalism","Preemption","State's Rights"]},{"id":168,"title":"Going Dark: Encryption, Technology, and the Balance Between Public Safety and Privacy","abstract":null,"publisher_text":null,"year":2015,"month":7,"day":null,"url":null,"authors":["Committee on the Judiciary"],"tags":["2010s","Child Exploitation","FBI","Going Dark","Government","Hearing","Law Enforcement"]},{"id":169,"title":"A \u201cstumbling\u201d US encryption policy","abstract":"\u201cAre those in opposition to the administration's [encryption] policy prepared to sacrifice public safety in the interests of commercial gain?\u201d Those words, uttered by Deputy Assistant Attorney General Robert Litt, would etch themselves in the minds of those who attended the 7 May 1977 House International Economic Policy and Trade hearing on \u201cEncryption: Individual Rights vs National Security\u201d.
